1) default.js - you can change the port

2) in development.js, production.js and uat.js  change the db name
    uri: 'mongodb://localhost/cars-app'

3) (optional) add    export NODE_ENV=development
    (# temporarily adding the env variable for contacts app) add to environment variable (to bashrc script in linux)

4) In Mongoose.js change the db name (previously contact)  and model path

5) change the model and add the required schema

6) in routes change the api path names

7) in controllers add the controllers (directed from route)

8) you can add database and collection name to display on robo mongo





// client side dependencies
In public folder

// install bower
npm install -g bower

// add client side dependencies
bower init

// to install angular js
bower install angular -S

// delete bower_componenets

//create lib directory under public

// create .bowerrc file  under root folder and tell where to install the frontend dependencies
 add the directory

bower install angular -S


// add the script in views folder
<script src="public/lib/angular/angular.min.js"></script>

//when req comes for public folder dont send to routes , we have to render/ send  the static content/files
 then add the     app.use("/public/", express.static(path.resolve('./public/'))); to express.js

 // install bootsrap  // uses media query
 bower install bootstrap -S


//angular js elements and attributes are custom elements and attributes in standard html
we use directives to write custom elements <dir>custom elements</dir

intiate angualar with html / angualar starts
<html ng-app="contacts-app">  //mandatory, the whole html gets a bubble called $rootScope(object literal) if it is on div then that div get a bubble

then
start global variablee
<script> angular.module("contacts-app",[])</script>  // mandatory


angular - 2 way binding (ng-model publish  and expressions subscribe

ng-model directive
<input ng-model="name">  when we give input takes the name got to bubble $rootScope and assign the value to variable name

{{name}} // angualr expression which goes and find the property name in the bubble $rootScope

we can create multiple ng-apps and have different (scopes)

we cannot have nested $rootScopes but can have child scopes (nested scopes) which is ng-controller


friday july 29

create default.js(to access client side resources) in assets folder

edit config.js add glob paths // need to write from rajesh

edit express.js to add the config path for static files to express.js

create app and controllers folder in the path core/client/

create config.js in app folder

create a core.client.controller.js in controllers folder

add the config and simpleControllers path to the script in core/server/views/index.server.view.html

npm install -S glob@5.0.13
npm install -S chalk

init.js under client

create folders css, routes, services, img, views, directives under core/client/
create core.client.module.js under core/client/ (security concerns)

create core.client.controller.js under core/client/controller/

edit index.html include the controllers

bower install angular-ui-router -S

adding the dependencies angular-ui-router and    in the client/core/app/config.js

bower install bootstrap -S

add nav bar in the index.html
 add the contacts in controller
 add the state provider in router

 deisgn the templates and route through them using angular routes
================================================================================================================
 Notes: routers(Layer1) are used to manage and switch between the templates in a SPA(Single page appliations).
 routers is one of layers
 controllers(Layer2): which has scope and controllers does the data binding and the views are used these stored data to diplay($digest)
services(Layer3): divided into
        1) service : uses function constructors (by default return current object (this)).
            a) builtin services -> $http $q, $resource (starts with $)
            b) custom services -> using Service , factory provider we have to write a custom service
         2) factory : modular design pattern / revealing object(retutns object literal)
         3) provders: configuration related
promises(layer4) javascript related
        - async implemented using call back fucntions
        - nested call backs- call back within callbacks (complexity and maintainability is hign and debugging is difficult),
         - To solve this we need promises
         -  promise definition : associated with two parties (P1-ask  P2-promise{instead of responding})
                                   after task completed P2 responds(success/fulfill or failure/reject) using callbacks
                                   acts like 3 way handshaking {1)ask, 2)promise, 3)resolves and gives response after task completed}
                 a) fulfilled
                 b) reject

         In angular prmises are given 3 ways

              1) $http - used for communication over network routes(/api/contacts) and methods change
              2) $q - everything on the client side (layers - routers, filters, controllers, services) communicate using $q
              3) $resource - if routes(/api/contacts) is same for different method we use $resource

            angular - $resouce -> bigger wrapper
            angular - $http    -> wrapped inside $resouce
            angular - $q   -> wrapped inside $http
            javascript - promise  ->  wrapped inside $q


dependency injection
   - all layers depend on each other
   - IOC inversion of control --
   - In angular does dependency injection using IOC
   - In nodejs we do the dependency injection
   - angular does the automatic garbage collection
   - controllers will ask for $scope and injects into funciton (register module an app) angular.module('core').contoller('ctl1',fn($scope){)
   - angular maintains registry(map- key and values) for each layer
   - initially contoller name will be key and function with scope will be value
   - similary in service, angular.module('core').factory('Serv1',fn(){}) serv1 will be key and func is value
   - controller ask for service angular.module('core').contoller('ctl1',fn($scope,Serv1)
   - similary for filter,angular.module('core').filter('Filt1',fn(){})
   - we cannot inject $scope into services and filters
   - controller ask for service angular.module('core').contoller('ctl1',fn($scope,Serv1,Filt1)
   - we can use diff inbuilt services like $http, $q ,$digest, $resource
